- Ray caster
- 3D projection
- Textures
- Weapon
- NPC
- Interactivity

## Initial setup
The first step is to setup up a feel parameters that are going to compose our settings file, as well as making our map, which at first, will be a numpy matrix, composed by zeros and ones (zeros being empty space).
